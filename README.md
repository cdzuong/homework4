# Homework 4
Due: September 19, 11:59pm

Use the following link to to create your private github repository for this assignment: 
https://classroom.github.com/a/uLcmQLn_

The repository will be seeded with the skeleton code and test cases. To generate JavaDoc documentation, after checking out the starter
code from github, open it in IntellJ, select Tools from the menu and then "generate JavaDoc". You will be able to specify the output directory.
Browse documention by opening index.html in the browser.

In this assingment, you will practice using Java arrays and learn how to manipulate "images". 
Fill in code in the following classes in packages arrays and imageManipulation:

-MyArray
-ImageProcessor (please see ImageProcessor.pdf on Canvas for images of expected results).

Please read comments above each method. Be careful to use only data structures that are allowed for each problem. For example, for several methods in class
MyArray, you are NOT allowed to use an extra array or ArrayList etc. Do not modify classes Pixel, Picture and MyArray. Do NOT modify the tests or the starter code except where the comments explicitly tell you to add your own code. Do not change the structure of the project.

MyArrayTester has been provided to you (inside test folder). Please note that you are responsible for performing additional testing - passing tests
does not guarantee that the code is correct.

### Submission Instructions

- Your code must (a) compile without any errors, (b) run, and (c) produce the correct output. If the code does not compile or crashes when we run it on a lab machine, it will result in a 0 for the assignment. 
  Your code must also pass the tests (do NOT modify the tests; if you want to add your own tests, add them in a different test file). Please note that class ImageProcessor does not have tests and needs to be tested manually. 
  The instructor provided basic JUnit tests for class MyArrayTester, but you are responsible for further testing your code. Passing the tests
  does not garantee that your code is bug-free!
- Your code needs to be committed to the correct github repository. Note that we cannot accept code submitted via Canvas or email. 
- Make sure your code follows the style guidelines described in StyleGuidelines.pdf (posted on Canvas). 
- This assignment is individual, no collaboration is allowed. You can go the professor, the TA or CS tutors for help.
